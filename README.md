## Dataset for EdgeShield

This dataset consists of benign jobs and four types of attack jobs (SINUS, EXPO, POISS and PW). 

All benign and attack jobs are generated based on resource usages/requirements obtained from the widely-used Alibaba Cluster Trace Program (https://github.com/alibaba/clusterdata).

The job processing time is generated by YCSB (https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB).
